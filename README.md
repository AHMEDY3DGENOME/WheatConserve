# 🌾 WheatConserve – Conserved Regions, SNP & Primer Analysis for Wheat CDS

**WheatConserve** is an interactive bioinformatics tool for analyzing conserved regions and SNP variations across multiple wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivars using CDS sequences. It also supports automatic primer design and BLAST-based functional annotation.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Upload multi-sequence FASTA files for wheat cultivars
- ✅ Perform multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
- ✅ Detect **conserved regions** with user-defined threshold
- ✅ Identify and filter **SNPs** (polymorphic positions)
- ✅ Automatically generate **PCR primers** around SNPs
- ✅ Visualize:
  - GC content per sequence
  - SNP distribution
  - Conserved region maps
- ✅ Annotate sequences using **NCBI BLAST**
- ✅ Export results: CSV, Excel, PDF

## 🧬 Example Use Case

Upload CDS sequences from different wheat lines. The tool:
- Highlights conserved regions between them
- Finds meaningful polymorphisms
- Designs primers for genetic markers
- Uses BLAST to predict gene/protein functions

Great for wheat genome researchers, molecular biologists, and bioinformatics educators.
